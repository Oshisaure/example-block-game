# example block game
A simple open source block game to show a working implementation of my block game engine

Powered by [Lua](https://www.lua.org/about.html) and [Love2D](https://love2d.org/)

### ok cool how do I play
First, get [Love2D v11.3](https://github.com/love2d/love/releases/tag/11.3) and install it.  
Next, download this repository as a zip file (click on the green Code button then click Download ZIP) and change the extension from `.zip` to `.love`.  
You should be able to double-click the `.love` file and it should open with Love2D.  
Then you can go setup your controls and have fun with the game hopefully.  

### do you mind if I mod this?
No, this is open source for a reason. Go ahead and fork this to your heart's contents, as long as you keep in mind the license.  
Although do keep in mind that I am still working on this so things like score system, sound effects and more settings will be in this at some point.
